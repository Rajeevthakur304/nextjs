        <p>The Exercise</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>From this list, rank your 5 most favorite and 5 least favorite support tasks. Provide a brief explanation for each.</p>
            <p>Ans: There are two kinds of problems in your life: the urgent and the important. The urgent are not important, and the important are never urgent. That being said, I would like to go through these tasks one by one and separate them by quadrant. Once I can see these tasks in the designated categories, I will be able to schedule them and accomplish my most important work. Once you know how to distinguish between designated categories (urgent and important tasks), you can begin separating your tasks into the four quadrants. Quadrant 1: Do Tasks in this quadrant are both urgent and important. They demand immediate attention as they have significant consequences and impact long-term goals. These are the tasks that are most pressing and likely causing you stress. Quadrant 2: Schedule This quadrant is for tasks that are important but not urgent. They contribute to long-term goals but don't require immediate action, allowing you to schedule them for later. Prioritize these tasks after completing those in Quadrant 1, employing strategies like the Pareto principle or the Pomodoro technique for effective time management. Quadrant 3: Delegate Quadrant three houses tasks that are urgent but not important to your long-term goals. Since these don't necessitate your personal attention or a specific skill set, delegate them to others. This approach not only lightens your workload but also aids in team development. Quadrant 4: Delete After sorting tasks into the first three quadrants, what remains are neither urgent nor important. These tasks are distractions hindering your progress and should be eliminated, fitting into the "delete" quadrant.</p>
            <p>These are the common support activities that one has to do at a certain point of time. I would like to rather organize the tasks by frequency alsoâ€“ Daily, Weekly, Biweekly, and Monthly:</p>
